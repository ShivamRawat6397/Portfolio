            Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shivam Rawat ðŸŒŸ, a dedicated and innovative web
            developer passionate about crafting immersive digital experiences.
            With a Master's in Computer Applications from Graphic Era Hill
            University and a Bachelor's from the same prestigious institution,
            I've honed my skills to transform ideas into reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey encompasses mastering cloud computing with AWS during my
            LTIMindtree Ignite internship and delving into data structures with
            Unacademy's Java DS & Algo course. From crafting seamless UIs with
            React.js to architecting robust backend systems with Node.js and
            Express.js, I thrive on turning visions into functional solutions.
            Let's connect and embark on this exhilarating journey together! ðŸš€
